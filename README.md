## About me üë®‚Äçüíª

I am an enthusiast of computers. Even though I did not always know, I have always been inclined to computer engineering/science. I learned to format a computer myself when I was a kid, always curious about computers and how they worked, always doing my own thing with them.

Although I was inclined to a computer-related major, I started college thinking about electrical engineering (focus on electronics). However, when I had my first programming course, it was love at first sight.

Then, I switched majors to computer engineering and never looked back.

Today, I am also interested in finance and getting an MBA in Value Investing so I can make better investment decisions throughout my life, and I intend on doing that with as much dedication as I have done so far with computer engineering/science.

## Goals

I have just one: grow üìà

There are several contexts where I would like to grow, however, but that is a conversation for the future.

## Experience

I worked both in academia and in industry in innovative environments.

### Academia

My work in academia has led me to join a distinguished group of researchers working in developing technology to help people with ADHD to be more productive by empowering them with feedback tools and sensory deprivation technology using Virtual Reality (VR).

üí° The idea is simple: 1) remove distractions, and 2) let them know they are off-task so they can come back on track.

‚ùì However, the practice is more complicated. I was challenged in many ways during the many experiments we ran because there were at least four different softwares deployed at the same time that needed to be coordinated. I had: 1) a backend running domain logic, 2) a web frontend to allow students to manage one-hour work sessions, which were the basis of each experiment we ran, 3) a local server to allow for communication across components, and 4) the VR app itself, developed using Unity.

üíª But I had to make it work. I was the solo developer working on all these components as other participants on the study were developing other software to along with the ones I have developed. It was indeed a challenge to synchronize them all, to keep all of the possible flows in mind, to orchestrate use cases in a coherent way, to use tools such as concurrent programming, message passing, and other techniques, but it did work.

üìà And the results are promising. Feedback collected directly with experiment participants about our technology reveals they are more productive when using it. Not only verbal feedback, but also objective data shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between increased productivity and usage of VR with feedback.

### Industry

üßë‚Äçüíº I also had the pleasure of working in a market intelligence company, helping them with several projects in interdisciplinary teams. Their work goes from data scraping all the way to presentation to the end customer. Since they provide a bridge from the raw data to the customer, they have internal processes for data extraction, data engineering, data science, and their very own application to power the functionalities their clients enjoy every day.

‚öôÔ∏è I helped them with almost all of those tasks, except for data extraction. I have had the opportunity to work directly with clients to help them define their own necessities in terms of software as well as develop that software myself along with the rest of the team. Many times, that included an ensemble of tasks on full-stack application development, data analytics/science, and data engineering. It sounds like a lot, and it was. However, I was able to learn a lot from those experiences, not only about development itself, but also about technologies such as azure, spark, and others, and even more about how theory gets applied in day-to-day activities with clients. This was a very transformative experience.

## Education

üéì Ph.D / Current - I am persuing a Ph.D degree in Computer Science at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

üíª Bachelor's / Major - I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the [Federal University of Techology - Paran√°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Technology_%E2%80%93_Paran%C3%A1)

## About this profile

Some of the latest repositories are private since either most data I work with is sensitive or the project is ongoing.

Also, I cannot reference some of the repositories I worked on because mainly they belong to companies I worked at. *However*, I can give a detailed explanation about them.
